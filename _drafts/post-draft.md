Abstract:

In order to create the conditions for peace in conflict ridden areas of the global - Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, etc. - justice must be ensured for individuals, groups, and communities affected and afflicted by war. Often in the aftermath of past conflict, peace is established through means counter to disarmament, economic recovery, and the transition to warring states and powers rejoining international civil society. This brief article draws on political philosophy to ask, first, what is peace, and second, what are the requirements for lasting peace. The ideas presented are intended to cut across deadly strife in order to establish a basis for humanitarian solidarity in the face of blind antagonism.

Why Study Peace?

Injustices are the root cause of war, and true peace is found only when all political debts have been settled. The inequity and rights violations which fuel violence have tempered the blade of polarization, state sanctioned crime, and factious politics on a global scale. Peace can arise through surrender or victory, but it is only permanent when the constituents to conflict are able to peacefully remedy the root cause of their grievances. This is only possible through the “process” of peace—the institutionalization of nonviolence.
	Since the onset of Russia’s war in Ukraine in 2022, the incursion and massacre by Hamas on October 6th in Israel and Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza, and April 15, 2023 the start of the war and corresponding famine in Sudan, the world has returned to a setting where the “scourge of deadly violence” again takes place among (previously) civilized nations. Such senseless deconstruction and violation of international norms has essentially rendered the institutions of democracy, political liberalism, and coalition based multilateralism powerless to prevent the further spread of conflict (Cortright 2008: 5). But is a just society possible which endeavors to escape war—war which is itself a perpetuation of injustice? Let us characterize war as the use of state-authorized force to achieve some political end—an end whose goal—rarely realized—is justice for the state. Before society, we lived in a state of perpetual war, in which all acts of injustice were met with deadly force—“war of all against all” (Hobbes 1996: Ch. 13). War can lead to peace, yes, but it is only a façade, because defeat or victory only leaves injustice to fester. 
	
Defining Peace

Let us examine three brief examples which show that the process of creating lasting peace must generally be assured only through non-violence. First, the resolution of the Cold War: a monumental shift in bringing about an end to nuclear brinkmanship, proxy wars, and neocolonial military intervention. After the peaceful resolution of the war, the world witnessed relative prosperity, guided by the UN and other global institutions (Cortright 2008: 111-115). Next, there was the success of non-violent resistance to oppression and injustice, where activists like Mahatma Gandhi in India sought liberation from colonial oppression (Ghandi 1982). This shows that justice can be achieved without the retributive and onerous use of force. Finally, however, not all movements for liberation from unjust colonial oppressors have been peaceful. The movement for the independence of Algeria, which culminated in war, took many lives, and marred or twisted many more (Fanon 1965; 1967). Movements that seek justice through violence often do not find it, and those that seek it through personal sacrifice, civil disobedience, and peaceful rebellion are more likely to develop agreements and institutions which do instill the values that led them away from war in the first place. 
	Conflicts that are resolved peacefully are more prone to induce the long-term stability necessary for just institutions amongst the parties involved. On the other hand, conflicts that are resolved violently or through the use of military action, though they will give us the apparent conditions of peace (absence of previous conflict), will, over the long run, be unstable. Without true peace, these parties cannot find justice, nor can they rebuild society to remedy the injustice that was the cause of violence. In this way the nonviolent resolution of war (true peace) is a necessary prerequisite of justice. This draws inspiration from the social contract theorists (Rousseau 2018; Locke 1997; Hobbes1996; Morris 1999), thus lasting peace is an agreement to sustain civil discourse about matters of dispute between parties.

The Philosophical Perspective

While the institutions of religion, law, economics, philanthropy, international markets for goods and services, science, and the arts maintain their civilizing pressure on society, they remain unprepared to respond to the uninhibited violence, oppression, and displacement that comes with large-scale conflict and “perpetual war” (Smith 1903: 2, 20). Indeed, Kant argued that even in a time of peace, “there is a constant threatening that an outbreak [of war] may occur” (Kant 1903: 118). Even whilst secured by our institutions, there is no guarantee that we do not fall under the threat of violence.
	In the process of defending the peaceful society, we can recover what originally drove us to move away from a state of war—the search for non-violent ends to attain personal and political justice. The solution I offer here is partly an acknowledgement that a violent end to conflict leads only to future violence. Peace needs to be made and acceded to freely. It also must be in the spirit of what Kant calls “universal hospitality” (Kant 1903:137)—the accommodation of another’s interests, values, and culture into the civic space that one presides over. The state of nature left the first humans without recourse—other than war—to the injustices of their age, but has led to a civilized and universal system of shared values, one where a culture of peace can only start with non-violence. To build a civilization with the crooked timber of humanity, we must first seek true peace (Berlin 2013; Kant 1991: 41-53).
