Holding two MSc degrees from LSE and Edinburgh, Jamesâ€™s academic journey reflects a commitment to understanding complex global issues. By using cutting-edge quantitative methods, James is not only identifying who is most affected by climate misinformation, but also revealing the mechanisms by which it undermines sustainability efforts. His work is poised to provide valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and industry professionals, in order to further sustainability efforts within their areas of work."
